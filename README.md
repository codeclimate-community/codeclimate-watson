# Code Climate ember-watson Engine

`codeclimate-watson` is a Code Climate engine that wraps [ember-watson](https://github.com/abuiles/ember-watson). You can run it on your command line using the Code Climate CLI, or on our hosted analysis platform.

## Maintainers Wanted

This engine has unfortunately fallen behind both `ember-watson` & Code
Climate's [spec](https://github.com/codeclimate/spec). Our team does not use
Ember, and hasn't had time to keep up on this engine. If you're interested in
helping modernize & maintain this engine, please [comment on the related
issue](https://github.com/codeclimate-community/codeclimate-watson/issues/10)
or get in touch with us at hello@codeclimate.com!

### Installation & Usage

1. If you haven't already, [install the Code Climate CLI](https://github.com/codeclimate/codeclimate).
2. Run `codeclimate engines:enable watson`. This command both installs the engine and enables it in your `.codeclimate.yml` file.
3. You're ready to analyze! Browse into your project's folder and run `codeclimate analyze`.
